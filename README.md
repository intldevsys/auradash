An adaptive data visualization dashboard that enables users to view complex data from multiple APIs using natural languageâ€”no advanced coding skills required. The platform streamlines analytics by allowing users to create real-time, interactive data visualizations with minimal setup via an LLM-powered assistant. AURAâ€™s modular, glassmorphic UI features customizable panels such as 3D global maps, entity networks, heatmaps, timelines, word clouds, and more. Itâ€™s inspired by advanced dashboards like IBM Watson News Explorer, but offers greater flexibility in panel management, data source integration, and user interaction.
